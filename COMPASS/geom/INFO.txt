All directorys and files present here are just a copy of the ones available at M. Imrisek shared
directory. So if any new Geometry is available it just needs to be added here, given it follows a similar
structure to these ones. It shouldn't also be too problematic to add what is needed in the  bib/bib_geom.py file
