## Directory structure

- `M/`  code necessary to extract the regularization matrix from existing reconstructions and perform new ones
- `NN/` code neccessary to train and apply the NN for COMPASS SXR system
- `bib/`  libraries created to perform a broad set of tasks common to the `NN/` and `M/` folders
- `data/` contains scripts to download the SXR measurements (still not available)
- `geom/` information about the COMPASS vessel geometry and lines of sight of the SXR system for different geometries

Further instructions on how to work with the code is given inside the `M/` and `NN/` directories
