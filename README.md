# PlasmaTomoML

Tomographic algorithms implemented based on machine learning techniques to perform tomographic reconstructions in JET bolometer setup and COMPASS SXR system. 

The code presented relates to the work developed for my M.Sc. Thesis [1] at [Instituto de Plasma e Fusão Nuclear](https://www.ipfn.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) - [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/pt/) (IPFN/IST) under the supervision of Prof. Diogo R. Ferreira and Prof. Horácio Fernandes. Includes the work that generated a contribution for the European Physical Society Conference in Plasma Physics ([EPS2018](https://eps2018.eli-beams.eu/en/)) conference in Prague [[2](http://ocs.ciemat.es/EPS2018ABS/pdf/P4.1005.pdf)].

Part of the code is based on the work previously developed by D. R. Ferreira in [[3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02242.pdf)] and can be accessed [here](https://github.com/diogoff/plasma-tomography)
