# PlasmaTomoML
Tomographic algorithms implemented based on machine learning techniques to perform tomographic reconstructions in JET bolometer setup and COMPASS SXR system. This work was developed during my M.Sc. Thesis entitled 'Plasma Tomography with Machine Learning' at Instituto de Plasma e Fusão Nuclear - Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisboa under the supervision of Prof. Diogo R. Ferreira and Prof. Horácio Fernandes
