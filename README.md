# PlasmaTomoML

Tomographic algorithms implemented based on machine learning techniques to perform tomographic reconstructions in JET bolometer setup and COMPASS SXR system. 

The code presented includes the work developed during my M.Sc. Thesis entitled 'Plasma Tomography with Machine Learning' at Instituto de Plasma e Fusão Nuclear - Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisboa under the supervision of Prof. Diogo R. Ferreira and Prof. Horácio Fernandes.

Part of the code is based on the work previously developed by D. R. Ferreira in ' for which can be accessed in https://github.com/diogoff/plasma-tomography
